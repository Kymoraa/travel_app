# travel_app

A new Flutter project.

This project is a result of a Flutter Coding challenge by @brocodev1 who is an amazing flutter dev from LATAM
The amazing YouTube tutorial by @diegoveloper can be accessed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEHPCwjLdno&ab_channel=diegoveloper

I would like to take this moment to give a huge shout out the dev community.
A lot of great content is shared on so many platforms for free! And I real enjoy consuming such content ‚ù§
